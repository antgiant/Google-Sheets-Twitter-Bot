# Google Sheets Twitter Bot

A tool for making an X (Twitter) bot that posts scheduled tweets using Google Spreadsheets. Because the software runs in Google Spreadsheets, and it requires the interaction of a specifically-constructed sheet with the underlying code specific to that sheet, this GitHub repo exists to share the underlying code in a canonical way.

The `.gs` files in this repository are the underlying GAS code for the dev version.

Note: This bot currently uses Twitters 2.0 API, supports only tweets, replies, and quote tweets without media and will only occassionally be updated. (Due to X (twitter) rules retweets without a comment are not supported.)
